# Code-Quiz
week 4 homework- create quiz with HTML, CSS, JS


## Description

We were instructed with creating a game using HTML, CSS and new JS concepts. We were to have a start button, timer, questions/answers, time subtracted when an incorrect answer is chosen which may result with a game over, and saving scores with initials. My game is to beat the clock...so a bit different than score time.
